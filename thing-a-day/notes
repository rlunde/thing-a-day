1) Import and Export format

Try using JSON like:

{"category-name":[
  {"id":"guid", "value":"some content"},
  {"value":"some other content"}
]}

If the id is set, an import should do an upsert, otherwise an insert.

2) Should provide for scheduled generation of periodic content

For example, have a tag name that refers to a category, that says to
generate 12 unique new items from a named category, once a day at 11:55pm.

That way, the API doesn't have to generate new content, just get the
cached content, which should be fast and efficient.
