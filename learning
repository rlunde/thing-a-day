technologies to learn and use - docker / go / react (or preact) / redux

Initially I planned to use scala for this, and I may still,
someday, as an alternate / additional approach. 

I thought about using angular 1.5 for this, since I'm really
enjoying a coursera class about it, but I just can't see
ever using angular 2, and it seems the world is heading there.
If angular 2 takes over the world, I'll have to learn it 
eventually, but since the UI for this project should be
minimal, I'm not going to worry about it.
