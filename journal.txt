Spent a little time defining what templates should look like. I need to
a) make some test categories
b) define error conditions (e.g. substitute a missing category)

Today's task is to simplify thing-a-day.

I think templates could either take the form of JSON,
where it's the callers job to then put the filled-in
template into a web page, tweet, email, or whatever,
or else it could be just text, in which case the 
template might actually be the body of whatever is
to be produced.

I think for now the simplest thing I could do
is make the template be just text (which could actually
be in JSON format, aside from substitutions).

Also, I can assume that I won't be running it as 
a service for multiple people, but that instead everyone
will run it themselves (or add auth themselves if they
want to support multiple people themselves).

So no auth required! That's such a huge
simplification, I think I may actually get this
done in the near future!

Boy, those were famous last words, huh?

I've been thinking about this project a lot over the
past couple of days, but haven't actually worked on 
it.

More tomorrow!
