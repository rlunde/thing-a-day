# Golang uses environment variables to find where things are and determine where to put things
# The environment variable that determines the location of the current workspace is GOPATH (although
# it can have multiple directories, to help it find things under multiple workspaces, but that's
# probably a little confusing to maintain).
#
# source this file, don't execute it
export GOPATH=$(pwd)
