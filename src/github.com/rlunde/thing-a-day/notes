1) Import and Export format

Try using JSON like:

{"category-name":[
  {"id":"guid", "value":"some content"},
  {"value":"some other content"}
]}

If the id is set, an import should do an upsert, otherwise an insert.

2) Should provide for scheduled generation of periodic content

For example, have a tag name that refers to a category, that says to
generate 12 unique new items from a named category, once a day at 11:55pm.

That way, the API doesn't have to generate new content, just get the
cached content, which should be fast and efficient.

To get started:

There's a "source-me" file two directories up that should set up GOPATH to
include this directory. Run it like:

source source-me 

(Assuming you use bash, of course.)

I thought about getting this running on Heroku first, but it turned out that
there was a LOT of things needed for that which won't be needed in general.

I'm not planning on backing up and starting with this example, which uses Gorilla:

I need to back up all the way. I want to have:
a) a working web site that people can use and enjoy
b) a complete sample of code that people can use to make their own stuff
c) something that doesn't tie people in to any particular company (e.g. heroku)

I need to find the simplest thing that can work across hosting companies.
