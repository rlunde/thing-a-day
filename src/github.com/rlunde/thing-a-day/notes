1) Import and Export format

Try using JSON like:

{"category-name":[
  {"id":"guid", "value":"some content"},
  {"value":"some other content"}
]}

If the id is set, an import should do an upsert, otherwise an insert.

2) Should provide for scheduled generation of periodic content

For example, have a tag name that refers to a category, that says to
generate 12 unique new items from a named category, once a day at 11:55pm.

That way, the API doesn't have to generate new content, just get the
cached content, which should be fast and efficient.

To get started:
go get github.com/revel/revel
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3

I'm having second thoughts on using revel, after having tried the samples. 
I wonder if this project really needs all the overhead?

To do this, follow the instructions to install revel and revel/cmd here:
https://revel.github.io/tutorial/gettingstarted.html

There's a "source-me" file two directories up that should set up GOPATH to
include this directory. Run it like:

source source-me 

(Assuming you use bash, of course.)

Then you can try "revel run thing-a-day"
