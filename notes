I'm trying to make the structure of this project map a little more closely to the standard
structure of a go workspace. See:

https://golang.org/doc/code.html

To install the things needed for revel, look here:

https://revel.github.io/tutorial/gettingstarted.html

Make sure you have git and mercurial installed, as well as golang, before continuing.

After you clone this repo, you will want to run the "source-me" file to set your
$GOPATH to this directory, then run:

go get github.com/revel/revel
go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel

To run it, execute the "run-it" bash script, or do what it does (after sourcing source-me):
revel run github.com/rlunde/thing-a-day

The next thing to do, as I found out from another project, is to make sure I get
it running on heroku, if that's where I'm planning to do it (or whereever else). Sometimes
the project structure has to change to fit the environment, and I'd rather do that
before things get complicated.
