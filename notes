1) Import and Export format

Try using JSON like:

{"category-name":[
  {"id":"guid", "value":"some content"},
  {"value":"some other content"}
]}

If the id is set, an import should do an upsert, otherwise an insert.

2) Should provide for scheduled generation of periodic content

For example, have a tag name that refers to a category, that says to
generate 12 unique new items from a named category, once a day at 11:55pm.

That way, the API doesn't have to generate new content, just get the
cached content, which should be fast and efficient.

To get started:

There's a "source-me" file two directories up that should set up GOPATH to
include this directory. Run it like:

source source-me 

(Assuming you use bash, of course.)

I thought about getting this running on Heroku first, but it turned out that
there was a LOT of things needed for that which won't be needed in general.

I'm not planning on backing up and starting with this example, which uses Gorilla:
https://github.com/sogko/slumber

I need to back up all the way. I want to have:
a) a working web site that people can use and enjoy
b) a complete sample of code that people can use to make their own stuff
c) something that doesn't tie people in to any particular company (e.g. heroku)

I need to find the simplest thing that can work across hosting companies.

-----------
I started moving things around, but haven't fixed anything yet. It's absurd to
imagine that under a directory named github.com/yourname/yourproject that you'd
have a directory structure that starts with github.com/yourname/yourproject, even
though the default go build configuration seems to expect that sort of thing.
Basically, they expect you to put your build configuration somewhere else besides
your github repository, which just seems silly to me. So I'm just moving everything
to the top of my repo, at least for now.

-----------
I'm going to go crazy and try yeoman again, with:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-gorest

That says:

 mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/<user>/<appname>
 cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/<user>/<appname>
 yo gorest
 go get .
 (optional) go get github.com/tools/godep
 (optional) godep save -r ./... 
  docker build -t <appname> .
  docker-compose up -d
  
  curl http://<dockermachineip>:3000/sys/info/ping
