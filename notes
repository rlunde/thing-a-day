I'm trying to make the structure of this project map a little more closely to the standard
structure of a go workspace. See:

https://golang.org/doc/code.html

To install the things needed for revel, look here:

https://revel.github.io/tutorial/gettingstarted.html

Make sure you have git and mercurial installed, as well as golang, before continuing.

After you clone this repo, you will want to run the "source-me" file to set your
$GOPATH to this directory, then run:

go get github.com/revel/revel
go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel
