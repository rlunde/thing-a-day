I'm trying to make the structure of this project map a little more closely to the standard
structure of a go workspace. See:

https://golang.org/doc/code.html

To install the things needed for revel, look here:

https://revel.github.io/tutorial/gettingstarted.html

Make sure you have git and mercurial installed, as well as golang, before continuing.

After you clone this repo, you will want to run the "source-me" file to set your
$GOPATH to this directory, then run:

go get github.com/revel/revel
go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel

To run it, execute the "run-it" bash script, or do what it does (after sourcing source-me):
revel run github.com/rlunde/thing-a-day

The next thing to do, as I found out from another project, is to make sure I get
it running on heroku, if that's where I'm planning to do it (or whereever else). Sometimes
the project structure has to change to fit the environment, and I'd rather do that
before things get complicated.

I've got another project, humorscope, that I plan to use this with to test it. So
far, just getting the time to look at it has been an issue.

I'm going to see if I can use GORM with it: https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm
I installed it via:

go get -u github.com/jinzhu/gorm

The postgresql driver appears to be pq:

go get -u -v github.com/lib/pq

Then I used postgres command line tools and created a user and database named "tad" (for thing-a-day):
createuser -d -e -r tad
createdb -e -U tad tad

Then in psql:
psql (9.4.5)
# grant all privileges on database tad to tad;
\q

Finally! The stupid NaNoWriMo month is over, and I can actually try to do something for real in github.

I'm not sure it's really a good idea to spend so much time trying to get things working in heroku? I don't
know how helpful that's really going to be to anyone else.

I added an InitDB function that connects to the database using regular sql, rather than GORM, as
a starting point. I'm not sure I should actually tackle GORM right away, since the database use
is going to be very trivial, as far as I can tell.
